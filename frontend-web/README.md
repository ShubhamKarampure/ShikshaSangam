# Frontend Setup (React)

Follow these steps to set up and run the React frontend:

### 1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory

Go to the `frontend-web` directory:

```bash
cd frontend-web
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/).

Once Node.js is installed, install the required dependencies for the React project:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the React application locally, typically at `http://localhost:3000/`. You can open this URL in your browser to access the frontend of the project.
