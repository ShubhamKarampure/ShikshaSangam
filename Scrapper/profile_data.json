            "description": "Real time adaptive signal processing is an area of considerable interest for the researchers in the field of embedded signal processing. Owing to the large dynamic range and constant relative accuracy of floating point arithmetic, filters are traditionally realized in floating point data type. However, using floating point arithmetic in embedded systems lead to larger cost in terms of latency, power and memory. Therefore these algorithms need to be implemented in fixed point for optimizing these constraints. However with the reduction in the word length the precision get affected. Therefore these algorithms need to be coded properly with adequate fixed point format such that precision is not affected while the resources are optimized. In this thesis an attempt has been made to implement Least Mean Square (LMS), Recursive Least Square (RLS) and Kalman Filtering algorithms on ARM Cortex M0+ with Thumb instruction set. The word length has been optimized for accurate performance, reduced power, improved speed and reduced memory usage. The validation of the algorithm has been carried out with respect to MATLAB."

Its purpose was to be able to take  a  binary  representation  of  a  MIPS  instruction  and  convert  it  into  microcode.    The microcode controls the actions of the processor and pipeline. Pipelining is a process of multitasking instructions in the same data path.  An instruction can be loaded into the data path at every clock cycle, even though each instruction takes up to 5 cycles to complete.  At every clock cycle, each instruction is stored into a different stage in the pipeline. Doing this does not affect any of the other instructions in the processor because they are in different stages. Each stage  contains  a  different  part  of  the  data  path  and  has  a specific function. This allows the user of the processor to fully utilize all components of the data path simultaneously, causing an increase in the throughput of their program."
